# dss-electrical-grid

In this project, I used data on electricity consumption, electricity prices, and power outages to build a simple statistical model to predict future electricity usage and power outages. In the future, I plan to add data on weather and socioeconomic factors into this analysis.

This project is part of the Data Science Society at Berkeley's General Membership Program, and was completed in Fall 2018.

### Data:

Electricity consumption: http://www.ercot.com/gridinfo/load/load_hist

Electricity prices: http://www.ercot.com/mktinfo/prices (use one of the historical prices dataset)

Power Outages: http://insideenergy.org/2014/08/18/data-explore-15-years-of-power-outages/ and https://www.oe.netl.doe.gov/OE417_annual_summary.aspx
